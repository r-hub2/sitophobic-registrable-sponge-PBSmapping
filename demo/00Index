PBSfig01		Map of the world projected in longitude-latitude
			coordinates.  Red vertical lines show boundaries
			for the 60 UTM zones, with explicit labels for
			zones 1 to 9.  A black line indicates the prime
			meridian.  The PolySet `nepacLL' lies within the
			clipping boundary shown as a blue rectangle.
PBSfig02		Shoreline data in longitude-latitude coordinates
			for the northeastern Pacific Ocean.  Vertical red
			lines display UTM boundaries.  A vertical dotted
			line indicates the central meridian of zone 6.
PBSfig03		Shoreline data for the northeastern Pacific
			Ocean, projected in UTM coordinates.  Vertical
			lines display UTM boundaries.  A vertical dotted
			line indicates the central meridian of zone 6.
PBSfig04		Vancouver Island as captured in our PolySet nepacLL
			(left) and the result of passing it into thinPolys
			with a tolerance of five kilometres (right).
PBSfig05		Example of the joinPolys logic operations. Panels A
			and B display the first and second PolySets,
			respectively. Panels C to F illustrate the difference,
			intersection, union, and exclusive-or operations,
			respectively. 
PBSfig06		Contourlines in Queen Charlotte Sound. Constructed 
			from R's contourLines() output and converted to a 
			PBS PolySet using convCP().
PBSfig07		Tracks for 45 tows performed during the 2001
			longspine thornyhead survey along the west
			coast of Vancouver Island.  A colour indicates
			the depth stratum for each tow.
PBSfig08		Areas (in square kilometers) of selected islands
			in the southern Strait of Georgia.
PBSfig09		Portrayal of `surveyData' from Pacific ocean
			perch surveys in the central coast region of
			British Columbia from 1966-89.  Colours
			portray the mean catch per unit effort within
			each grid cell.  Circles show locations of
			individual tows.
PBSfig10		Proof of Pythagoras' Theorem.  Four blue
			triangles plus the yellow square and the
			green square equal four blue triangles plus
			the red square.
